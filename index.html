              A network blessed with its valuable catch; It was created by
              remarkable insight and creative energy of attraction, practiced in
              addressing minds and gaining acceptance, and sincere in weaving
              cords of affection to enable the approach of participation and the
              cross-fertilization of knowledge, striving to diminish fallacies
              and construct solid edifices that fragrant with the fragrant scent
              of confident information and from which exudes the oil of
              Salsabil, whose share is the insights of those with minds who
              believe that knowledge is Ko on spending And his spending is
              transmitted to his guardians and narrators. Today, we are in great
              need of such reliable knowledge networks. May God bless your
              sincere and distinguished efforts, Dr. Ibrahim, who is classy and
              inspiring towards more giving and advancement.

              Greetings, love and appreciation There are many websites that have
              appeared on the Internet in recent years, some of which quickly
              stopped their activity upon launch and did not develop and keep
              pace with events, while others withdrew and disappeared after
              being cut off from the lifeline represented by the continuity of
              communication and giving. While the Iraqi Date Palm Network
              website continued to expand and develop, hoarding information and
              files on everything related to this blessed tree and pumping it
              out to an audience thirsty for knowledge and knowledge of
              researchers and scholars, and with every update the site advances
              and enters deeper into the consciences and hearts of followers,
              and the links are strengthened more and more with scholars and
              researchers to spread the results of their efforts and giving.
              While the number of visitors, browsers, and seekers of knowledge
              and knowledge increases. Until the site appeared in its new form
              in its latest wonderful update, bringing about a major leap in
              design, content, form and image, display, and rapid browsing and
              downloading, to attract its followers and gain their admiration,
              including myself, which prompted me to write these lines. A word
              of truth must be said here that this effort, which the dear
              brother, Professor Dr. Ibrahim Al-Jubouri, stands behind alone, so
              to speak, is incapable of governmental institutions and
              departments, with their cadres and funding, to come up with
              something similar to it, but what is more important than that is
              to perpetuate its survival and development, expand the circle of
              its followers, and carry out its message. Thank you very much, my
              dear brother, Dr. Ibrahim for everything you do for our aunt
              Nakhla. She deserves such a wonderful website that suits her.

              All greetings, appreciation and respect to my brother, Professor
              Dr. Ibrahim Al-Jubouri, for his distinguished efforts in
              collecting the modern and historical scientific heritage of the
              date palm, this generous tree over time in Mesopotamia and the
              world. I am honored that I was one of the contributors to
              supporting this scientific edifice, which will remain a beacon for
              generations that love the blessed palm tree. I hope for Brother
              Professor Ibrahim, Health and Wellness, for his care and
              continuity of this unique scientific site in the world. I salute
              you, my brother Ibrahim, from the heart for this qualitative
              achievement in the world of agriculture

              After browsing the site, Professor Ibrahim took us through all
              aspects of palm activities and research. The truth is that
              Professor Ibrahim has a distinct and unique charisma, and what he
              reviews on his site is not the work of an individual, but rather
              an integrated, professional scientific publishing institution. My
              admiration for the wonderful artistic design, the tabulation of
              topics, and the narration of the biographies of palm scientists
              increased. By God, it is a beautiful and great work, and he should
              be honored for his effort, and our scholars in their different
              countries should follow the same approach in documentation. In
              conclusion, we salute our colleague Professor Ibrahim and take off
              our hats out of respect for his wonderful efforts and initiatives.

              The Iraqi Network for the Date Palm. What do you know? What is
              this network? It is an important site with the scientific,
              heritage and historical material it contains about our aunt, the
              date palm. She was a contemporary of the site from the first word
              and the first publication. It is a pride for me and for all those
              interested in the Arab tree. It is an effort that I do not think
              is equal to the effort and the information it contains is pearls.
              Priceless; appreciation and respect for everyone who published and
              posted information, but hats off to the owner of the site and the
              founder of the Iraqi network, my brother, friend and colleague,
              Professor Dr. Ibrahim Al-Jubouri, who is the initiator and
              perseverant and who bears full responsibility for this site to
              remain a beacon that guides everyone to every piece of
              information. Abu Al-Yasmine, words are not enough. But you and the
              site believe with the palm tree, there are distinguished and
              blessed efforts, and the new version is frankly wonderful, and God
              willing, the site will continue to be renewed with your efforts,
              and good luck and always moving forward.
